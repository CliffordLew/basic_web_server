This project is just to help me better understand the basics 
of how servers work on python, I got most of the code from 
https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/ but I'm putting
in comments so I know exactly what each part means and 
can use this as a reference when needed.

TO CONNECT:
telnet localhost 8080 (telnet <address> <port #>)
GET /hello HTTP/1.1
